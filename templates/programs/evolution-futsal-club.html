			<h6>This program was developed and designed for children between the ages of 6-14</h6>
			<p>We apply a high-performance methodology through activities that demand high levels of attention to detail. Athletes will play tournaments and friendly games, gaining experience through real-time play on various skill levels.</p>
			<p>A high level of futsal playing requires that all players be able to make quick and effective decision-making that does not negatively compromise the outcome of the game. During training, many factors are important such as speed of information processing, understanding of space and time, and adaptation as new experiences are acquired and new Skills are exposed.  In this program, the goal of the coaches is to gradually develop the technical and tactical skills of the athletes through training adjusted to obtain higher physical yields for the execution of balance movements, body and ball control, positioning, and movement in the court, in addition, we focus on attack and defense strategies, cooperation, dialogue and teamwork, and the use and improvement of the skills of all athletes. </p>
